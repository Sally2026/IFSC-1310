      <h2>Web Accessibility</h2>  
      <h3> What web accessibility means to me? </h3>
      <p> Web accessibility means building websites and creating online content that is usable by everyone, regardless of their physical abilities, disabilities, or the devices they use.</p>
      <h4>Why is it important to build accessible websites?</h4>
      <P> One of the primary reasons why building accessible websites is crucial is its significant impact on people with disabilities. </P> 
      <blockquote> According to the article “Understanding the Importance if web accessibility” by <em> Leas Seibert </em>“According to the World Health Organization and the CDC, <strong> 16% </strong>of the world's population, and <strong> 26% </strong>of the U.S. population, have a disability. That's over <strong> 1 billion </strong> billion people worldwide and around <strong> 86 million </strong> people in the U.S. who may be unable to access websites that are not designed with accessibility in mind. This can include physical, sensory, cognitive and intellectual disabilities. With such a large portion of the population affected by disabilities, it is essential that websites are designed to be inclusive and accessible to all.</blockquote> 
      <P> Furthermore, accessibility benefits other groups, including older individuals and people living in country areas. Also, from a business perspective, accessible websites improve user experience and increase customer satisfaction, ultimately benefiting the business.</P>

      <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p> This project was my first website project to build from scratch, and I was extremely nervous about it. At first, I doubted my ability to complete it, but eventually, I succeeded. In the beginning, it was particularly challenging to focus on the project with everything else happening in my life. As I began working on it, I met several obstacles, especially with the design aspects of using CSS. However, these challenges turned out to be a valuable learning experience, helping me gain a deeper understanding of CSS.</p>

      <p>After completing my first draft, I found a few areas that needed improvement. Before making changes, I decided to get feedback from my friend, Dilasa Yaman. Her suggestions confirmed what I had already noticed, such as adjusting the screen size for the background section, updating the footer color to match the logo, and refining the form to integrate it into the site better. She also reminded me to validate my code for every page.</p>

      <p>When I started on the revised version of my website, I mostly struggled with the screen size for the background section. I tried so many times but I could not fix it so I asked my friend Dilasa to look at my code and see if she could figure it out. But after a million tries, we could not figure it out, so I decided to ask Professor Wallace and even after he gave me the solution for it it did not work I kept trying with it and realized that I linked the wrong file which was the first draft version to the home page that was why nothing changed when I was working on it. This mistake was a lesson to me, and I will never forget it. </p>

      <p>Web technology was a great class; I really enjoyed it. It was my first time learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned so much from this class that I will take this knowledge with me further. I did so many wonderful things in this class, and it was a great experience as a first-timer.</p>
