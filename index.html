    <h2>Web Accessibility</h2>  
    <h3> What web accessibility means to me? </h3>
    <p> Web accessibility means building websites and creating online content that is usable by everyone, regardless of their physical abilities, disabilities, or the devices they use.</p>
    <h4>Why is it important to build accessible websites?</h4>
    <P> One of the primary reasons why building accessible websites is crucial is its significant impact on people with disabilities. </P> 
    <blockquote> According to the article “Understanding the Importance if web accessibility” by <em> Leas Seibert </em>“According to the World Health Organization and the CDC, <strong> 16% </strong>of the world's population, and <strong> 26% </strong>of the U.S. population, have a disability. That's over <strong> 1 billion </strong> billion people worldwide and around <strong> 86 million </strong> people in the U.S. who may be unable to access websites that are not designed with accessibility in mind. This can include physical, sensory, cognitive and intellectual disabilities. With such a large portion of the population affected by disabilities, it is essential that websites are designed to be inclusive and accessible to all.</blockquote> 
    <P> Furthermore, accessibility benefits other groups, including older individuals and people living in country areas. Also, from a business perspective, accessible websites improve user experience and increase customer satisfaction, ultimately benefiting the business.</P>
